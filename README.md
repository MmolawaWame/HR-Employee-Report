### Data Cleaning/ Preparation 

In the initial data preparation stage, we carried out the following tasks:
1. Loading data and inspection
2. Creating the database
3. Renaming columns
4. Adding and removing columns
5. Changing column datatypes


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the customer data to get answers to questions such as:

- How many employees are there by gender?
- How many employees by race are there?
- How many employees are there in each department with respect to gender?
- How many employees work on-site compared to remotely?
- What is the distribution of employees by state?
- What is the age distribution of employees?
- What is the average length of employment for the company?
- What is the distribution of jobs roles in the company?
- What is the turnover rate for the company by each department?
- What is the average tenure in each department?
- What is the yearly rate in which employees are hired and fired?


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- There are more male employees compared to female and non-conforming ones.
- The majority of employees are white.
- There are more employees in the Engineering department, with the majority being male personnel, followed by female and no-conforming.
- Approximately 75% of the employees work on-site compared to remotely.
- A large number of workers come from the state of Ohio, whereas the smallest number comes from Wisconsin.
- There are five major age groups and the majority of employees are in the 36-45 category.
- The average length of employment in the company is around 10 years.
- There are 185 job titles within the company and 754 employees hold the Research Assistant II role.
- The highest turnover rate is in the Auditing department.
- The Marketing department holds the longest tenure being 7 years.
- The sum of employment gets a sharp increase between 2000 and 2001 but has slight fluctuations thereafter until 2018, where there is a steady decline from there to 2020. The sum of terminations on the other hand are gradually increasing, with a minor fluctuation from 2006 to 2012.

### Limitations
Some termination dates were far into the future and could not be used for the analysis.
